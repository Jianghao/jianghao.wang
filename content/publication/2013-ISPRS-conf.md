abstract = "The validation of remote sensing products (RSPs) is fundamental work before the proper use of RSPs. This paper mainly introduces the technical specification for the validation of remote sensing product, which is used to guide user how to validate the available products. The validation of remote sensing products (VRSP) mainly there are two levels. The first level focuses on the validation at pixel scale and the other is the product level which contains a number of pixels that are distributed in different land use types which are selected to represent both the space-time characteristics of surface parameters investigated. At pixel scale, the validation procedure mainly consists of three steps: sampling design for ground observation, data collection and estimation the mean value at pixel scale. The data types of ground observation include the wireless sensor network, which are used to capture multi-scale heterogeneities of surface parameters, and the footprint which could be a flux observation such as eddy covariance (EC) and large aperture scintillometer (LAS). After finishing the validation at pixel scale, the second-level validation for the whole remote sensing product is followed. The assessment with indexes is then used to evaluate the performance of the validation. Last, a validation report on the description of the validation will be included in the technical specification."
