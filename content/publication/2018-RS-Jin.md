abstract = "Spatial downscaling of remotely sensed products is one of the main ways to obtain earth observations at fine resolution. Area-to-point (ATP) geostatistical techniques, in which regular fine grids of remote sensing products are regarded as points, have been applied widely for spatial downscaling. In spatial downscaling, it is common to use auxiliary information to explain some of the unknown spatial variation of the target geographic variable. Because of the ubiquitously spatial heterogeneities, the observed variables always exhibit uncontrolled variance. To overcome problems caused by local heterogeneity that cannot meet the stationarity requirement in ATP regression kriging, this paper proposes a hybrid spatial statistical method which incorporates geographically weighted regression and ATP kriging for spatial downscaling. The proposed geographically weighted ATP regression kriging (GWATPRK) combines fine spatial resolution auxiliary information and allows for non-stationarity in a downscaling model. The approach was verified using eight groups of four different 25 km-resolution surface soil moisture (SSM) remote sensing products to obtain 1 km SSM predictions in two experimental regions, in conjunction with the implementation of three benchmark methods. Analyses and comparisons of the different downscaled results showed GWATPRK obtained downscaled fine spatial resolution images with greater quality and an average loss with a root mean square error value of 17.5%. The analysis indicated the proposed method has high potential for spatial downscaling in remote sensing applications."
